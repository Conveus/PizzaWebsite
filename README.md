# PizzaWebsite

This is a project I undertook as part of the Novus Program to create a website to order pizza.

Problems:
- When going back to the menu page from the basket page, the menu page does not load the items to its basket variable.
  Choosing any other item will overwrite it.
- CSS is not effecting the item panels properly. There is supposed to be space between the quanitiy selector and button.
  Additionally the non-pizza items scale differently with the page than the pizza ones
- Couldn't figure out how to get only three items to display next to each other before going down a line
